      <h2>Suburbs word cloud</h2>
      <p>
        After collecting multiple reviews from the three suburbs in
        www.homely.com and creating a word cloud analysis, we found some
        differences between suburbs which led us to think that this information
        could expose the gentrification level in the analysed suburbs. For
        instance, Toorak most repeated words were Great, Mansion, high,
        expensive, millionaire, etc, whereas, Footscray some of the most
        frequent words were truck, public, addict, to name a few.

      <h2>Usual behaviour of suburbs</h2>
      <p>
        After analysing Instagram and suburbsâ€™ reviews we also searched for the
        most rated places to visit around Brunswick, Toorak and Footscray, where
        we found that the three suburbs are offering the same type of
        activities, such as Food and hotels, despite the gentrification level
        they all have.

      <h3>Toorak</h3>

      <h2>Social Trends - Insta Moods!</h2>
<p>Chart 1 compares the most current photos posted on Instagram for the 3 sister suburbs. The photos are grouped into broad categories to help identify trends in topics of interest to each local community. People and pets seem to be of broad appeal across all 3 of the sister suburbs. However, the Footscray community appears to differ in a greater interest in food and beverage. Whereas Toorak posted more photos relating to buildings and businesses, and outdoor was most popular in Brunswick.
